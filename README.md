# Illya Gerasymchuk - DeFi, Zero-Knowledge, Blockchain and AI

Hello there! 👋 I'm Illya, an entrepreneur and engineer deeply invested in the realms of DeFi, Zero-Knowledge, Blockchain, and AI. As a TLS 1.3 Contributor and Contributing Member of the Python Software Foundation, I'm passionate about developing revolutionary products that redefine our interactions with money and bolster our digital privacy.
